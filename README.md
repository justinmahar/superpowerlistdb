# The Superpower List Database

The Superpower List is a user-generated database of superpowers that was in operation at superpowerlist.com from 2008-2016. The database contains some 12,000+ superpowers, all of varying levels of sophistication, hilariousness, and creativity.  Each superpower in the database contains an overview, description, pros/cons of having that power, and keyword tags, along with some other meta information. The name of the user who originally submitted the superpower is also included.

Over the years I received many inquiries to provide a downloadable database of superpowers. Since the site is no longer in operation, I decided to put these 12,000+ superpowers up for anyone to use, free.
